# cats-dogs

This is my DNN code for a cats vs dogs image classifier.

I used the resulting model to determine if my cat would be identified as a cat. Read about it here:

Steps to train your own model:

1. Set up file structure properly:

/
* data
* cats_dogs
* sort.py

2. Run `sort.py` to sort training data into `cat` and `dog` folders
3. Run `train.py`, or adjust image_size, batch_size, model parameters, etc. first.
